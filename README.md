## Overview
Donut Dog is a game where you get to roll exciting dice and collect cute animals. Animals have two traits: **smallness**, represented by small numbers, and **cuddliness**, represented by large numbers. Many animals are both! This is a quick-playing game, and designed to be friendly to kids, but there are layers of interesting strategy and seasoned gamers will find plenty of interesting decisions to make.

## Components
The PDF is <somwehere>
* 2 sets of D&D dice per player (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). Many 10-sided dice mark the 10-sided die with a 0 on one face. Treat this as a 10)
* The main deck of 42 Animal cards
* 8 Fish cards, with a different back and not part of the main deck
* Turn Order tokens, numbered 1-4
* 4 Player Aid cards
* VP, Reroll, and Magic tokens

## Goal
The goal is to acquire the most victory points (represented by stars). VPs are gained for collecting high-quality animals, collecting a wide variety of animals, and collecting bonus VP through the spare die bonus. 

## Setup

* Shuffle the main deck of cards and put it in the middle of the table.
* Put the stack of Fish cards face-up next to it.
* Give every player 2 full sets of dice, a player aid card, and 1 Reroll token.
* Put the rest of the tokens in an accessible supply location. (They are not piece-limited.)

## Gameplay

The game takes place in 7 rounds. In each round, every player will roll 4 dice. 3 of those will be used to collect one animal, and the spare will be used to collect a bonus.

### Round Setup
1. Deal 2 Animal cards, plus 1 per player, out to the middle of the table. (So in a 4-player game, 6 cards are dealt.) These are the animals that are available for collection this round.
2. Each player privately selects 4 dice and rolls them. There is no restriction in what dice they can choose amongst the 12 dice in their sets. They **may** use Reroll and Magic tokens at this point.
3. Small animals are fast! Each player puts forward their **highest** die. Of these, the **lowest** number gets to go first--give that player the Turn Order token labeled 1, the next player the Turn Order token labeled 2, etc.
