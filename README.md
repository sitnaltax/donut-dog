# Donut Dog
A cute animals collecting card game that gives you an excuse to use your D&D dice. ~15 minutes, 2-4 players, ages 8+

by Rob Herman

## Overview
Donut Dog is a game where you get to roll exciting dice and collect cute animals. Animals have two traits: **smallness**, represented by small numbers, and **cuddliness**, represented by large numbers. Many animals are both! This is a quick-playing game, and designed to be friendly to kids, but there are layers of interesting strategy and seasoned gamers will find plenty of interesting decisions to make.

## Components
The PDF is <somwehere>
* 2 sets of D&D dice per player (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). Many 10-sided dice mark the 10-sided die with a 0 on one face. Treat this as a 10)
* The main deck of 42 Animal cards
* 8 Fish cards, with a different back and not part of the main deck
* Turn Order tokens, numbered 1-4
* 4 Player Aid cards
* VP, Reroll, and Magic tokens

## Goal
The goal is to acquire the most victory points (represented by stars). VPs are gained for collecting high-quality animals, collecting a wide variety of animals, and collecting bonus VP through the spare die bonus. 

## Setup

* Shuffle the main deck of cards and put it in the middle of the table.
* Put the stack of Fish cards face-up next to it.
* Give every player 2 full sets of dice, a player aid card, and 1 Reroll token.
* Put the rest of the tokens in an accessible supply location. (They are not piece-limited.)

## Gameplay

The game takes place in 7 rounds. In each round, every player will roll 4 dice. 3 of those will be used to collect one animal, and the spare will be used to collect a bonus.

### Round Setup
1. Deal 2 Animal cards, plus 1 per player, out to the middle of the table. (So in a 4-player game, 6 cards are dealt.) These are the animals that are available for collection this round.
2. Each player privately selects 4 dice and rolls them. There is no restriction in what dice they can choose amongst the 12 dice in their sets. You **may** use Reroll and Magic tokens at this point.
3. Small animals are fast! Each player puts forward their **highest** die. Of these, the **lowest** number gets to go first--give that player the Turn Order token labeled 1, the next player the Turn Order token labeled 2, etc.

### Player Turns
In turn order, you decide how to use your dice. You **must** allocate 3 dice to collecting an animal and the last die to collecting a bonus. Most animals require both small and large die rolls to collect. If you don't like your dice available, you may also use Reroll and Magic tokens at this point.

#### Collecting an Animal

* The **Blue Down Arrow** requires a die showing its number or **smaller**. So this Cat requires a die showing 3 or less.
* The **Red Up Arrow** requires a die showing its number or **greater**. So this Cat requies another die showing 6 or more.
* The **Gray Double Arrow** can be any die at all. So this Cat can use any die for its third die.

Some animals have a light blue bar on top. This just calls attention to the fact that they are worth an extra point (and have stricter die requirements than common animals of that type)

Note that Fish are always available, so you can always use any 3 dice to collect a Fish.

#### Spare Die
With your spare die, you can choose and collect a bonus. Usually you will save it for a future turn, but you can use a Reroll or Magic token on the turn you get it. You can always choose a "lesser" bonus if you want it; so with a spare die of 11, you could take a Reroll token, a Magic token, or a VP. 

* With any die, you may claim a Reroll token. You can spend this to **reroll any number of your dice**. You may reroll one, some, or all of them--whatever you like. You have to keep the same dice, though--you can't swap them out.
* With a die showing 7 or higher, you may claim a Magic token. You can spend this to **change any one of your dice to any result you want.** Just pick it up and put it down however you like.
* With a die showing 11 or higher, you may claim a VP token.
* With a die showing 19 or higher, you may claim a VP token and also a Reroll token!

### Round Cleanup
Discard any uncollected animals; they will not show up again this game. All players return their Turn Order tokens and put their dice back into their pool, and a new round begins.

### Game End
The game ends after 7 rounds. Players add up their scores:
* Animals are worth their printed VP
* 1 bonus VP for every different kind of animal
* VP tokens are worth 1 VP each

The player with the most points is the winner!
